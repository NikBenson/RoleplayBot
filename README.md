Hello and welcome. In the following document we will guide you through the features and first usage of our discord bot.

## What is ROR Bot
ROR Bot is a module based discord bot to make your RP server much more customizable. You can activate modules per server and use them. We provide you some official modules, but you can easily [create new ones](https://github.com/NikBenson/RoleplayBot/wiki/How-to-create-modules) if you know the basics of java.

## Official modules
